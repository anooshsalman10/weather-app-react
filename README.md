### Weather App (React)

A responsive **Weather Application** built with **React.js** that allows users to search for any city and view real-time weather information. The app fetches live data from a weather API and displays essential details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions using intuitive icons.

This project focuses on core **React fundamentals**, including state management with hooks, handling user input, API integration using `fetch`, and conditional rendering based on API responses. The UI is designed to be clean, minimal, and responsive to ensure a smooth user experience across different devices.
